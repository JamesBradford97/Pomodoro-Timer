# Pomodoro-Timer
A basic Pomodoro timer using HTML, CSS and JavaScript.
This is a one page webapp meant to function as a basic pomodoro timer. Users can choose between five (5) pre-set time intervals (5, 10, 25, 60 and 120 mins) after which an alarm beeps.
There are dedicated start and stop buttons for controlling the timer.
There isn't any option for customization at the moment, as the goal was to build a basic one that worked. 
I initially built this to refresh my front-end development skills but I'll most likely add more features when I can.
